## Overview

I've been looking for an excuse to try out duckdb for a while now.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Approach

1. load data into warehouse un-transformed
1. given that the data sets are fairly simple, build `VIEWS` on top of the RAW layer to handle for simple transformations
    1. convert `transaction_date` from a datetime to a date
1. build a fact table for inventory
1. run analysis


---

## Next Steps
- model the data in dbt
